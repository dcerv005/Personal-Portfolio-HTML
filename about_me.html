        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>As I have mentioned before my name is David Cervantes! I originate from Miami, FL but I currently reside in California.
            My family is from Peru and I try to keep up with my families heritage and culture. I work for the Department of the Navy as a Mechanical Engineer. 
            That job oppurtunity was the reason behind my grand more from coast to coast. That was back in 2018 and it has been an interesting ride. California has been great to explore.</p>

        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>My career goals has taken a turn this year. I was once interested in pursuing a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. 
        After taking an intro to Software Engineering course, that quickly changed. My career goals now is to finigh the Coding Temple bootcamp and become a full stack developer, Software Engineer, or anythinkg in between.</p>

        <h2>Personal Interest</h2>
        <p>My interests have maintained consistent throughout the years. I try to watch and play sports as much as I can. My favorites are Soccer, Basketball, and Football. 
        I follow all of the Miami teams still even if I dont live there anymore. Travel has also been a big part of my life, and has quickly become a huge interest in my life. 
        Coding has been a practice that peaked my interest in college and now I am this interest as a priority. </p>
